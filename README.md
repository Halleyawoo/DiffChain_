## Description

We propose a novel framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation using chained diffusion-based pseudo-label refinement.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- CUDA 11.x
- Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` (to be provided if necessary)

## Data Preparation

- **ACDC**: Download from the official SSL4MIS repository: [https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS/tree/master/data/ACDC](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS/tree/master/data/ACDC)

- **MS-CMRSEG19**: Download from the official challenge website: [https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/mscmrseg19/](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/mscmrseg19/)

- **Task05 Prostate (Medical Segmentation Decathlon)**: [http://medicaldecathlon.com/](http://medicaldecathlon.com/)


## Usage

Train the model with the following command:

# Example: Train the segmentation model on ACDC with 1 labeled patient
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_diffrect_chain_ACDC.py \
    --exp ACDC/diffrect \
    --labelnum 1 \
    --num_classes 4 \
    --root_path ./datasets/ACDC
